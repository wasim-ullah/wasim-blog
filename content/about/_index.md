I am into marketing 80% technical and 20% creative, which makes me a 100% growth hacker – the best wave of digital marketers thus far. My second side is full-stack marketing – a full-scale digital marketing work.<br>

With extensive experience in building a strong brand presence across all the digital media platforms with a sales funnel, I craft and implement successful digital marketing strategies. That will earn any startup, small and medium-sized businesses best on their ROI.<br>
