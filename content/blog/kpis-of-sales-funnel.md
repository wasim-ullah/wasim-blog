![Sales Funnel Key Performance Indicators](/images/funnel.jpg)

Have you ever found yourself trapped in between optimizing every single step of your marketing campaigns?
As a newbie, you might thinkn of a marketing campaign as an advertisement or a post update that links to a website where you will collect the leads or sign ups. But that's not it. The story of sales funnels and its KPIs starts from the point when you want to take care of your marketing with some standardized forms of action.
In a nutshell, a sales funnel will build your layout and KPIs will act as its components.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be tracked by some of the most commonly used metrics. However, variations of these metrics depend upon your business goals.

## Awareness
An awareness stage, as the name suggests, is the top level in your funnel. It brings in the most number of audience in your campaign in comparison to all the other stages. Every tom dick and harry shall come to see you no matter what causes come to visit your landing page.
<ul>
  <li>Pageviews</li>
  <li>Impressions</li>
  <li>Reach</li>
  <li>Cost-Per-Mille (CPM)</li>
</ul>  

## Acquisition
When you are able to get some people on board, that's your zero to one game. This stage wants to ensure you are getting closer to what you are aiming for. If you find trouble in this stage, it's obvious that you would have targetted the wrong audience, distribution channels or your message is not clear enough to persuade people to take an action.
<ul>
  <li>Followers</li>
  <li>Leads</li>
  <li>Click-Through-Rate (CTR)</li>
  <li>Cost-Per-Click (CPC)</li>
</ul>  

## Conversion
Once acquired, you must be converting a lot of users. A conversion can be anything, from a simple sign up to a lead or a sales. It depends on the goals of your marketing plan. If you are not able to convert, your offer must be unfit for your users.
<ul>
  <li>Conversion Rate</li>
  <li>Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA)</li>
</ul>

## Retention
Who does not want to stay together? Well, your users don't want to stay when they don't feel you are useful to them. The market competition, innovations in products or services, and users ever changing expectations makes your retention harder and harder. Thus, your funnel shall almost always find it extremely hard to hold the users together.
<ul>
  <li>Email Opens</li>
  <li>Email Shares</li>
  <li>Lifetime Value (LTV)</li>
</ul>

## Referral
This is a sweetheart of a marketing department. Your referrals are a tasty sugar that won't cause you diabetes. A lot of marketing funnals can be made more powerful when you are able to get referrals. Now you will know why everyone wants to do viral marketing, it's because it gets shares aka referrals.
<ul>
  <li>Referral Shares</li>
  <li>Invites accepted</li>
  <li>Referral Rate</li>
</ul>
